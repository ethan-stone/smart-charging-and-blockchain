# smart-charging-and-blockchain

# Overview
You can open the project, install all the dependencies and run `anchor test`. This tests the smart contract I made and it works

However when the smart contract is deployed I ran into some problems I could not solve. In `frontend` run `npm start` and go through the demo.
On the last page where the smart contracts are ran unfortunately it doesn't work. Somehow the accounts are signed correctly even though the tests pass
and I couldn't figure this out.
